# Handwritten Text Generation using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning–based handwritten text generation project that converts typed text into handwritten-style output images using handwritten word samples from a dataset.

The system searches matching handwritten word images from the dataset, crops them, combines them together, and generates a final handwritten sentence image.

---

## Project Overview

Handwritten Text Generation is a dataset-based text-to-handwriting generation system developed using Python and Streamlit.

This project does not recognize handwriting. Instead, it generates handwritten-style output from typed text input.

The application works by:

- Taking text input from the user
- Searching handwritten word samples from the dataset
- Cropping matching handwritten words
- Combining cropped words into a sentence
- Generating a final handwritten output image

This project demonstrates concepts related to:

- Machine Learning
- Dataset Handling
- Image Processing
- Text-to-Handwriting Generation
- Streamlit Web Applications

---

## Features

- Convert typed text into handwritten-style output
- Dataset-based handwriting generation
- Handwritten word image cropping
- Dynamic sentence image generation
- Interactive Streamlit web interface
- Lightweight and easy-to-use system
- Multiple word sentence support

## Dataset Information

This project uses a handwritten word image dataset.

The original dataset is not fully included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.

### Removed folders:
- train/
- test/
- valid/

### Dataset Link

https://huggingface.co/datasets/corto-ai/handwritten-text/tree/main/data

---

## Technologies Used

### Programming Language
- Python

### Libraries
- Streamlit
- Pillow (PIL)
- Pandas

---

## How the System Works

### Step 1 — User Input
The user enters text in the web application.

Example:

```bash
Hello World
```

### Step 2 — Text Splitting
The sentence is split into individual words.

Example:

```bash
["Hello", "World"]
```

### Step 3 — Dataset Search
The application searches the dataset for matching handwritten word samples.

### Step 4 — Word Cropping
Matching handwritten word images are cropped from dataset samples.

### Step 5 — Sentence Generation
The cropped handwritten words are combined together on a blank canvas.

### Step 6 — Final Output
The final handwritten-style image is generated and displayed to the user.
